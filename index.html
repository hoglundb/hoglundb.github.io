            <img src="./Images/ObjectPoolingThumbnailImage.png" alt="Object Pooling Thumbnail"

            <p>
                This project implements a robust and efficient object pooling system using C# and Unity, designed to
                optimize
                performance by reducing costly object instantiation and garbage collection. Leveraging <em>.NET
                    object-oriented
                    principles</em>, it features a generic <code>ObjectPool<T></code> class, an abstract
                <code>PoolableObject</code>
                base class for inheritance, and a centralized <code>PoolManager</code> for streamlined access and
                management. A
                practical, time-based example illustrates its effectiveness. This design enhances performance, promotes
                code reuse, and
                demonstrates <em>solid software engineering practices applicable beyond game development</em>.

            <p>
                A full-stack chess application built with React and Node.js that integrates
                <strong>react-chess</strong> for the interactive board UI, <strong>chess.js</strong> for game rules and
                validation,
                and a backend Stockfish AI engine for strong computer opponent moves. Features custom React components
                for game setup,
                time controls,
                endgame overlays, and AI bot selection. Designed primarily for Linux, but easily adapted to Windows with
                alternate
                Stockfish binaries.
                This project highlights clean integration of third-party chess libraries, asynchronous AI processing,
                and modern React
                state management.
